These are some programs written in C that I ported to run on classic
Apple Macintosh computers using the Retro68 cross-compiler.

I have tested them on a Mac 512Ke and a Mac Classic.

You will need to set up the Retro68 tools.

I used a BMOW Floppy Emu disk emulator to read the generated floppy
images on the Mac.
